      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Audience Feedback Transcript</h1>
      <p> Now then, look at all the audience feedback I have collected. There are a couple of trends, such as the majority of the female audience members chose Purple 2 as the background they liked, and how most of the age range is between 40 to 50.

 most of them like the clear layout along with the colour scheme and how informative it is whereas in the don't like section pretty much all of them say that the text could be increased as it is too small and the things that could be improved

 is mainly the size of the font but there are some other things such as fleshing out the about founder portion of the about me page or the about us page adding extra graphics changing where the values page is located along with adding just more information and fleshing out the overall layout of the site

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Making The Website Transcript</h1>
      <p>So how did I go about making my website? Well, why did I make it in the first place? I made this website as an expansion of the business cards that I designed during Project 5. I decided on making a website simply because I already had previous experience using the familiar

 languages and code type editors. I was primarily skilled in HTML but mainly in Python so a lot of the things I put into my website were new to me as I didn't have a lot of experience with such

 information and things. So how did I go about creating this website? Well I started off upgrading the logo that I used during the business card and by that I had to upgrade it to make it more professional and extended and like much better than a simple rough drawing.

 I asked a variety of people from various backgrounds for colour schemes and the layout along with what I should include. And those surveys gave me a nice list that I could use to generate the website and make sure everything was in the nice placements and things.

 there were portions of the code itself that i had to make but make myself as i couldn't find a direct way of finding a solution to it online but if i couldn't think of anything to try remedy the problem i had i would borrow code from a different

 free to use areas that were situated on the web not to mention i had to do research based on my competitors in this field this field being it repair services

 So what issues did I really encounter whilst creating this website? I had many code issues such as colour changing as the code would work in one instance on an older site that I had developed, but it wouldn't integrate properly into the newer one. So I had to tweak around, consult an AI chatbot,

 because I was completely lost. I tried to find remedies online but eventually I got a hold and fixed it and it was surprisingly simple. Finding different colours that would appeal to all aspects of my target audience

 minor admin work uh locating pricing just like simple things like that to be honest but back to the code issues there was many that were really easy to fix and just like one or two edits but some would take up like

 about an hour or two just to remedy that being the previously mentioned color changing for the different styles of the site and also just trying to get everything integrating such as me having to remove the footer because it would not integrate properly with the color changing and i was running out of time to try to fix it
